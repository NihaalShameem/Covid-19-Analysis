# Overview of Project
In this project, I wanted to gain insights into the Covid-19 pandemic. I imported the csv data file from kaggle and imported the necessary lbraries needed to complete the analysis.
From doing the analysis I was able to gain insights into 171 countries total deaths, confirmed cases, and recovered cases. 
With that information I or you could do further analysis into which countries had the most deaths, most cases, least cases and etc. There are endless insights you can gain from the data.
Lastly I made a visualiztion using matplotlib to show the world's covid 19 Totals as a whole.
